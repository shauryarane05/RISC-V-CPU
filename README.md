#### The RISC-V CPU will be implemented with IMAF instruction extensions, and also verified using custom verification methods.

### Introduction

RISC-V  is an instruction set architecture like ARM based on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Architecture) principles. What sets RISC-V ISA different from others ISAs is its completely open source and free to use.

Due to being open-source in nature, RISC-V provides a vital step in designing, building and testing new hardware without paying any license fees or royalties

### How to flash the code on FPGA

To flash the code in your FPGA, you must have first have yosys suite installed. Installations can be done from [here](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)

After installation, navigate to your cloned repository and into the code folder
```
$ cd RISC-V-Eklavya-23/code
```

and run following command 
```
$ make flash
```

This will create binary file for flashing on FPGA, make sure that your FPGA is connected to your device before running above command

## Workflow
This a 2-stage processor. In the first stage, 
- The instructions are fetched and decoded.
- Values are read from register file.
- Determination of instruction type. 
- Sending necessary parameters to ALU if needed.
- Writing in DMem and sending read signals. 
- Send jump to PC. 

And in 2nd stage,
- Get ALU output
- Read Data from DMem.
- Control Unit writes to register file 
- PC executes jump instruction 
- Show output on seven segment display.

Following is the block diagram and workflow in simple terms of our CPU:-
